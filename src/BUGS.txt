WINDOWS/LINUX

- super flacky imager volume shader support
- rendering panel settings sometimes are not serialized
- dirty state does not work on every command that modifies state
- qt combo boxes in rendering panel (filter) sometimes miss the signal currentIndexChanged

LINUX
- syntax highlighting SL code doesn't work (QT syntax highlighter class infinite loop when parsing a block)
- poor graphics view scrolling performance (maybe a driver issue?)
